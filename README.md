# Irongoon

The Irongoon mod for [Severed Chains](https://github.com/Legend-of-Dragoon-Modding/Legend-of-Dragoon-Java) allows an "Ironmon" style of play for Legend of Dragoon.

# Alpha
I expect some things to break or weird behaviours. Please report them as an issue.

Aside from that, experiment with the config settings (different randomizer options) and see what is fun.

# Irongoon Rules
The [Irongoon Rules](https://gist.github.com/Ink230/76197fd8251de5e0927d99077e0c1124) is a WIP goal of capturing the Ironmon essence.

Some rules are currently impossible, not implemented, or need further discussion on their worth.

# Irongoon Settings

The mod permits customizing the randomizer and having different randomization options. This is done through the use of a config.yaml file.

A default configuration file is included in the latest release.

Please see the [Config Reference](https://github.com/Ink230/irongoon/wiki/Config-Reference) for an explanation on all the settings.
