# Irongoon

The Irongoon mod for [Severed Chains](https://github.com/Legend-of-Dragoon-Modding/Legend-of-Dragoon-Java) allows an "Ironmon" style of play for Legend of Dragoon.

# In the Beginning
Experiment with the config settings (different randomizer options) and see what is fun.

Quick Notes

- Early game is heavily balanced around power functions, there is some attempt at adjusting for this but good luck
- You may deal lots of damage but you may also take lots of damage âœ”

At the moment, the mod is a glorified character and monster stat randomizer. Elements, additions, rewards, and some combat mechanics are somewhat doable and will be done next. Everything else in the Irongoon ruleset needs additional mod support to implement.
# Irongoon Rules
The [Irongoon Rules](https://gist.github.com/Ink230/76197fd8251de5e0927d99077e0c1124) is a WIP goal of capturing the Ironmon essence.

Some rules are currently impossible, not implemented, or need further discussion on their worth.

# Irongoon Settings

The mod permits customizing the randomizer and having different randomization options. This is done through the use of a config.yaml file.

A default configuration file is included in the latest release.

Please see the [Config Reference](https://github.com/Ink230/irongoon/wiki/Config-Reference) for an explanation on all the settings.
